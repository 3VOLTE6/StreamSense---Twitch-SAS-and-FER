# Twitch Livestream Sentiment Analysis and Face Emotion Recognition

This project integrates advanced Sentiment Analysis and Face Emotion Recognition models for Twitch livestreams, providing real-time insights into both viewer sentiments and streamer emotions.

## Key Components

### Sentiment Analysis (SAS)
- Model: Utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for its superior context understanding capabilities.
- Fine-Tuning: The model is fine-tuned specifically for Twitch chat messages to improve accuracy in sentiment classification.
- Dataset: Compiled from Twitch chat logs, including preprocessing and manual labeling of messages as positive or negative.

### Face Emotion Recognition (FER)
- Model: Implements Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) for robust face detection.
- Emotion Recognition: Uses DeepFace for accurate real-time emotion recognition, providing insights into the streamerâ€™s emotional state during broadcasts.

## Features

- Real-Time Data Processing: The system processes and analyzes chat messages and video streams in real-time, offering instant feedback on the emotional and sentiment dynamics of the stream.
- Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly web application built using React and Node.js allows users to visualize sentiment and emotion data, enhancing the viewing experience and providing valuable insights for streamers.
- Comprehensive Metrics: Detailed metrics and visualizations of sentiment analysis and face emotion recognition results, helping users understand audience reactions and streamer emotions at a glance.
- Custom Emote Classification: Incorporates classification of Twitch-specific emotes to improve sentiment analysis accuracy, understanding the unique language used by Twitch communities.

## Implementation Details

- Data Collection: Utilizes a GitHub tool to extract chat logs from past Twitch streams in JSON format.
- Data Processing: Employs Python scripts for parsing and organizing data, ensuring that only relevant information (e.g., username, message content) is included.
- Data Labeling: Manual labeling of the dataset with positive and negative sentiment tags to create a robust training set for the model.
- Real-Time Integration: Models are integrated into the web interface to provide real-time analysis and visualization of ongoing streams.

## Future Enhancements

- Multimodal Analysis: Integration of audio analysis to provide a more holistic understanding of interactions and emotions.
- Continuous Learning: Implementing models that adapt and improve with continuous learning based on new data from live streams.
- Enhanced Real-Time Processing: Improving the efficiency and speed of real-time data processing to handle larger volumes of data with minimal latency.
- Advanced Emotion Detection: Exploring the use of more sophisticated deep learning architectures to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition.
